# Brief description

Code for fitting a mixture distribution to a dataset of pvalues with R

# Mixture distribution for a set of p-values

Given a set of p-value, this code provides an example about how to fit a mixture distribution to this data. Specifically, next mixture distributions were fitted:

1. Uniform distribution + 1 beta distribution
2. Uniform distribution + 2 beta distributions
3. Uniform distribution + 2 triangular distributions
4. Uniform distribution + 2 exponential distributions

Using a sample of p-values resulted from several statistical tests, the aim of this example is to estimate the proportion of these p-values that comes from the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>). The methodology is quite similar to that one explained in the next article:
