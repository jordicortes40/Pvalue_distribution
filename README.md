# Pvalue_distribution

Brief description: Fit a mixture distribution to a dataset of pvalues with R

# Distribution mixture for a set of p-values

Given a set of p-value, this is an example about how to fit a mixture distribution to this data

Specifically, next mixture distributions were fitted:

1. Uniform distribution + 1 beta distribution
2. Uniform distribution + 2 beta distributions
3. Uniform distribution + 2 triangular distributions
4. Uniform distribution + 2 exponential distributions

Using a sample of p-values, the aim of this example is to estimate the proportion of p-values comming from the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) of several tests (regardless of your type) with distribution U(0,1)

The methodology is quite similar to that one explained in this article:
